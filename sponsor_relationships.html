            <p>We keep communicating with our sponsors frequently and promoting STEM education. We invited Ford engineers come to our base, showing how we prepare for Ventura Regional. Our captain, Tianshu Wang carefully introduced our robot and every function of our part.</p>
            <p>Later, Ford engineers brought students from High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University, Jiangning Branch. They were planning to participate in Australia off-season  competition in July. We gave them advice of making a better robot and taught them what was essential in training. They also watched our robot and got impressed. While STEM manias were exchanging ideas about FRC, Ford engineers communicated with our main mentor for further sponsorship. They claimed that they were glad to work with us and explored the promotion of STEM.</p>
            <p>Engineers from Shanghai San Ze Technology Co. Ltd. came to our base many times. Our drive team showed our excellent and smooth operations which left great impressions on them. San Ze engineers also taught us how to use Solidworks Composer. We could make lots of animation and display pictures with the help of Composer.</p>
            <p>San Ze engineers also checked our engineering drawings and found many incorrect places. They helped correct the drawings which made us more professional. They also wanted to give our team members lectures about drawing on Solidworks. In this way, we got a big hall in High School Affiliated from Nanjing Normal University. We also invited students from High School Affiliated from Nanjing Normal University to join our lectures. Our team members learned a lot from lectures.</p>
